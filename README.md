# Ignite Your Fundraising With Braintree 50K Offer

[Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) started an offer called ["Make $50K. Keep $50K"](https://www.braintreepayments.com/faq#free-processing) in 2014. Basically, they offer to waive the processing fees for the first $50,000 transaction of a "startup".  

A recent communication with Braintree support staff clarified that a nonprofit could take this offer as well, as long as 

1. it's new on Braintree
2. monthly transaction is less than $80,000

It also appears Braintree would likely to offer a discounted rate (similar to Paypal) to a tax-exempt nonprofit. However, this would void the 50K offer.

So, you (a tax-exempt nonprofit) will have two options in terms of fee structure when integrating Braintree:

 1. Take the 50K offer. When that runs out, you get charged regular rate (2.9% + $.30 per transaction)
 2. Don't take the 50K offer, but take an ongoing discounted rate (2.2% + $.30 per transaction)

It's obvious that for a small nonprofit with tax-exempt status, this offer could bring some saving in transaction (processing) fees. I guess there are some math to be done in each different case. 

Now, ready ? Here's how to [get started](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/get-started/overview).
